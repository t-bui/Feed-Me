# Feed-Me
CS 4640


Feed Me is a web application that is designed to help UVA students find free food on grounds. Organizations often give out free food, but there is not a central location for students to find these opportunities to eat free meals. Organizations or other students that know about the free food and its time and location will have the ability to post information about the food along with an expiration time when it should be removed from the site.
